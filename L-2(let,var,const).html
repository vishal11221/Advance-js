    <p>In let keyword we not redeclare the value but reassign,it is block scope.</p>
    <p>Var can be redeclare and reassign,it is global scope.</p>
    <p>Const cannot be redeclare and reassign,it is block scope.</p>

    <script>
        var x = "rohan";
        var x = "vishal";//re-declare x.
        x = "raj";//reassigning value to x
        console.log(x);
        //both are possible only in var keyword.



        let a = "rohan";
        // let a = "mohan"; Here we not redeclare a again.because with the help of let keyword we not redeclare
        a = "sohan";
        console.log(a);


        const b = "rohan";
        // const b = "pankaj";
        b = "sohan";

        console.log(b);//it give also error because re-declare and reassign value is not possible with constant keyword.
